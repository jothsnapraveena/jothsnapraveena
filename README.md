## About Me

# Hello, I'm Jothsna ðŸ‘‹

Currently pursuing Masters in Data Analytics at Clark University,Worcester,MA,USA.

I have a diverse background that spans both academia and the practical world of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I spent four years as an Assistant Professor, sharing knowledge on a wide range of subjects within this field. My journey then led me to the role of an Assistant Engineer at an electricity board, where I faced the challenges of addressing public complaints related to frequent power interruptions.

## The Spark of Data Analysis

During my career, a recurring challenge was the lack of comprehensive data to understand and resolve the issues causing these power interruptions. To address this problem head-on, I took the initiative to collect the necessary data, delving deep into the quest to uncover the root causes of these disruptions.

This experience sparked my interest in the world of data analysis. Driven by a relentless desire to learn and adapt, I embarked on a journey of self-improvement. My dedication led me to complete a series of certification courses on Coursera, culminating in the achievement of a Postgraduate Certification in Data Science from the esteemed Indian Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIITB).

## Building a Strong Foundation

Along this educational path, I solidified my grasp of fundamental concepts, including inferential statistics, data analysis using tools like Pandas and NumPy, and the intricacies of machine learning algorithms. Armed with this knowledge, I am well-equipped to tackle complex data-driven challenges.

## The Road Ahead

At this stage in my career, I am eager to continue evolving and honing my skills. My goal is to apply these skills to real-world problems, making a tangible impact in the realm of data analysis, engineering, and beyond. This GitHub profile serves as a platform to showcase my projects and contributions, so please feel free to explore and collaborate.

Thank you for visiting, and let's embark on this data-driven journey together!
