## Summary of my Journey
Hello, I'm delighted to introduce myself as Jothsna.Currently I am doing Masters in Data Analytics at Clark University,Worcester,MA,USA.
I've spent four years as an Assistant Professor in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering field, teaching a wide array of subjects.
After that, I transitioned to the role of an Assistant Engineer at an electricity board.
During my career, I often faced challenges when addressing public complaints, primarily because we lacked the necessary comprehensive
data to understand and solve the issues causing frequent power interruptions. 
To tackle this problem, I took it upon myself to gather the data needed to uncover the root causes of these interruptions.
This experience ignited my interest in data analysis, prompting me to embark on a journey of self-improvement. 
Fueled by a strong desire to learn, I completed a series of certification courses on Coursera, ultimately earning a 
Postgraduate Certification in Data Science from Indian Institue of Information Technology Bangalore(IIITB). 
Along this educational path, I gained a solid grasp of fundamental concepts like inferential statistics, 
data analysis using tools like Pandas and NumPy, and the intricacies of machine learning algorithms.
At this stage in my career, I'm eager to further develop my skills and apply them to real-world problems.
